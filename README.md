Chesso is an animated, Jetpack Compose-based app aimed beginners and intermediate players for studying purposes.

Its distinctive key feature is the ability to show visualisation layers on top of the board.

## Import a game

You can import a game from a [PGN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Game_Notation) format:

- Either by directly sharing a game from another chess app via a system dialog
- Or copy-pasting a PGN text into the Import dialog


## Fair play

This app is meant for studying purposes and having fun only. Never use this app to gain an unfair advantage when playing a real game.
